In order to successfully connect to the database locally, you will need to create 2 .env files.
From your root folder:
    1 - Create a new file called <.env.test>. This is where you will put the database name in order to connect to it. This will allow you to connect to the test database which is used to run all the necessary tests.
    2 - Create a new file called <.env.development>. This is where you will put the database name in order to connect to it. This will allow you to connect to the database which contains the real data.
